4. Questions to Ask the Client Regarding Subscription/Payment

When discussing subscription and payment options with your client, here are some critical questions you can ask to ensure clarity and smooth integration:

Subscription Model:

What type of subscription plans would you like to offer to your users?

Are you thinking of a monthly/annual subscription model or pay-per-event?

Would you like a free tier with limited features?

Do you want to offer different pricing tiers based on features or event scale?

For example, different tiers for basic, premium, or enterprise users.

What features should be available on each subscription tier?

Example: Does the basic plan include vendor marketplace access, while premium includes access to more advanced features like analytics?

Should vendors also have subscription plans to access your platform?

If so, what would the vendor pricing structure look like?

What payment methods would you like to support?

Credit card, PayPal, Stripe, or other local payment methods?

Would you like to include automated billing and invoicing for your users and vendors?

Payment Integration:

How would you like to handle payments for vendor services?

Should payments be processed directly through your platform, or should vendors handle payments on their own?

Do you want a commission-based payment structure where your platform takes a fee for each event booking or transaction?

What should happen if a user wants to cancel a subscription or an event booking?

Do you have a refund policy, and how should it be managed on the platform?

How would you like to handle taxes and VAT (if applicable) within the payment system?

Should taxes be automatically added during checkout?

Do you want to offer any promotional discounts or coupon codes for users?

If yes, how should these be applied to subscriptions or bookings?
